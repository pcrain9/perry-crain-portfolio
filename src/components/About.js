            <Typography variant='p'>From understanding foundations of computing using C and Java to dedicating myself to the inner-workings of front- and back-end web, Iâ€™ve mastered React.js (functional and class-based components). I learned core features of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, at which I am now adept. My back-end learning involved diving into core features of Node.js and the Express.js library.  I a learning more and more about web development every day and my passion for the field has never wavered!</Typography>
